# Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm

This algorithm :
* takes the numerical evalutaion of an integral by the Simpson's 1/3 Rule
* performs the Trapezoid Rule on the last interval if there are an even number of intervals

Required inputs:
* a vector of x-values (equally spaced)
* a vector of y-values, dependent on the x-values
